Data from G6-1.5K- simulations for four models - UKESM1.1, CESM2-WACCM6, E3SMv3 and MIROC-ES2H, are freely available on the Reflective Cloud Hub platform, stored on a private S3 bucket accessible from within the hub, under s3://reflective-persistent-prod-large/<model>/<experiment>/

Other CMIP, and GeoMIP data (and the ARISE-1.5K-SAI simulations, are available via the commercial cloud, on both AWS and the Google Cloud. See links below for details, or the [example notebooks here](https://reflectivecloud.github.io/Book/Resources/example_notebooks.html). 

Access routes for data from recent GeoMIP simualtions are listed in the [google sheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gNgWTGHZ3BsKzuqri2lVTJa8JW2lFuQQwUmzLS8boG0/edit?usp=sharing), and file paths on the [Reflective Cloud Hub](https://reflectivecloud.github.io/Book/intro.html) for data stored on that site's associated AWS S3 bucket are shown in [this google sheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cjgJQSrDV_IQVN68HoTQpy_xGQQhPy4wz1N0u8E2Pe4/edit?usp=sharing).
